> Tools for preprocessing scanned images for OCR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kba/ocrd_dfkitools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kba/ocrd_dfkitools)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/syedsaqibbukhari/docanalysis.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/syedsaqibbukhari/docanalysis)

The sequence of operations is: binarization, deskewing, cropping and dewarping
(or can also be: binarization, dewarping, deskewing, and cropping; depends upon
use-case).

Sample files are available at [OCR-D/assets](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd-assets/tree/master/data/dfki-testdata)

## Tools included

### ocrd-anybaseocr-binarize

This function takes a scanned colored /gray scale document image as input and do the black and white binarize image.

Extracted from ocropus-nlbin (from https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy/).

### ocrd-anybaseocr-deskew

This function takes a document image as input and do the skew correction of that document.

Extracted from ocropus-nlbin (from https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy/).

### ocrd-anybaseocr-crop

This function takes a document image as input and crops/selects the page
content area only (that's mean remove textual noise as well as any other noise
around page content area)

### ocrd-anybaseocr-dewarp

This function takes a document image as input and make the text line straight if its curved.

## Installing

To install anyBaseOCR dependencies system-wide:

Alternatively, dependencies can be installed into a Virtual Environment:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -e .

## Testing

To test the tools, download [OCR-D/assets](https://github.com/OCR-D/assets). In
particular, the code is tested with the
[dfki-testdata](https://github.com/OCR-D/assets/tree/master/data/dfki-testdata)
dataset.

Run `make test` to run all tests.
